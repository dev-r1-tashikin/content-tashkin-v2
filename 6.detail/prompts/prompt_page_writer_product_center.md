# Prompt: Product Center Page Content Generation

## Role
You are a UX-focused copywriter and brand strategist, operating under the persona of **"The Sharp Mentor"**. Your tone is that of a **"Rigorous Expert"**. You are tasked with creating the content structure for the `Tashikin Diagnostics` Product Center page.

## Core Task
Generate a complete JSON content structure for the Product Center page. This page must serve as a highly functional, searchable, and filterable catalog of all our diagnostic test kits. Your primary goal is to empower veterinarians to find the exact product they need with maximum efficiency.

---

## 1. Visual Layout & Content Map (The Wireframe Blueprint)
Your final JSON output must map to the following page structure. The `slot_id`s are the required keys in your JSON object.

*   **`product_center_hero_section`**: The page's main headline and introduction.
    *   `slot_id`: `pc_h1` (Main Headline)
    *   `slot_id`: `pc_intro` (A brief intro explaining the value of the portfolio)
*   **`product_filters_section`**: The interactive filtering controls. This is data-driven.
    *   `slot_id`: `pc_filters_h2` (Headline for the filter area)
    *   `slot_id`: `pc_filter_categories` (An array of filter objects, generated from product data)
*   **`product_grid_section`**: The main display area for all products.
    *   `slot_id`: `pc_grid_h2` (Headline for the grid)
    *   `slot_id`: `pc_product_cards` (The full array of all products from the data source)

---

## 2. Input Data & Strategic Context
The executing AI must synthesize the following:

*   **Core Strategy (from `1.0_tashikin_内容战略白皮书.md`)**:
    *   **Cost Blade**: This page is the tip of the "Cost Blade." The copy, while professional, should reinforce the core value proposition of **"Exceptional Quality, Unbeatable Value"** (卓越品质，极致性价比).
    *   **Trust Foundation**: Every product listed is a building block of our brand's trust. The page should feel reliable and comprehensive.

*   **Data-Dependency (`product_filters_section` & `product_grid_section`)**:
    *   **Source File**: `整理策略/dim_products.json`
    *   **Instruction for `pc_filter_categories`**: The AI MUST process the `rows` in the JSON. It will identify all unique `product_category_name` values. It should then clean and consolidate them if necessary (e.g., "infectious disease, parasite" could be represented in filters for both "Infectious Disease" and "Parasite"). It will then create an array of these unique category names to be used as filters.
    *   **Instruction for `pc_product_cards`**: The AI MUST ingest the entire list of products from the `rows` array in the JSON file. Each product card object must contain the `website_display_name` and its corresponding `product_category_name` to allow for front-end filtering.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Execution Plan for the AI

1.  **Generate Hero Content**: Write a strong `pc_h1` that acts as a simple, powerful title for the page (e.g., "Tashikin Diagnostics Product Center"). For the `pc_intro`, write a short paragraph that emphasizes the comprehensiveness, reliability (`Powered by NomoFlow™`), and value of our portfolio.
2.  **Generate Filter Categories**: 
    *   Read the `dim_products.json` file.
    *   Create a unique, clean list of all `product_category_name` values to populate the `pc_filter_categories` array. Handle multi-category products correctly.
3.  **Ingest All Products**:
    *   Read the `dim_products.json` file again.
    *   Create an array of objects for `pc_product_cards`, where each object represents a product and contains all its original data from the JSON row.
4.  **Assemble Final JSON**: Combine all generated content into a single, valid JSON object, using the `slot_id`s from Section 1 as the keys.

## 4. Example of High-Quality Output

**For `pc_intro`:**
> "Welcome to the complete portfolio of Tashikin Diagnostics. Every test kit on this page is built on our `NomoFlow™` manufacturing platform, ensuring world-class reliability and batch-to-batch consistency. We are committed to providing exceptional clinical value and unbeatable performance, empowering you to make confident decisions for every patient."
